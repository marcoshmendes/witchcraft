# Witchcraft - AI-Powered Video Dubbing Tool

**Witchcraft** is an open-source command-line tool that automates the process of dubbing videos into another language. Its primary goal is to make educational content and online videos more accessible to people around the world by enabling them to consume content in their native language.

While we aim to incorporate as much open-source technology as possible, this tool leverages powerful APIs from industry leaders like OpenAI and Google to ensure high-quality results. Open-source components are included wherever feasible.

## Features

- **YouTube Video Input**: Simply provide the URL of a YouTube video.
- **Automatic Transcription**: Extract the speech from the video and generate a timestamped transcription.
- **Translation**: Translate the transcription into the target language.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Generate audio from the translated transcription.
- **Synchronization**: Ensure the new audio aligns perfectly with the original video.
- **Seamless Output**: Replace the original audio track in the video with the newly generated dubbed audio.

Steps to Automagically Dub Videos with AI

Transcription with Timestamps

Extract speech from the video and generate a timestamped transcription.

API Used: OpenAI Whisper

Translate the Transcription

Translate the transcribed text into the target language.

API Used: OpenAI GPT models for high-quality translation

Text-to-Speech (TTS)

Generate new audio from the translated transcription.

API Used: OpenAI TTS (or other advanced TTS APIs for specific languages)

Synchronize the Voice with the Video

Align the newly generated audio with the video’s original timings to ensure proper synchronization.

Tools: FFmpeg for timing alignment and adjustments

Replace Original Audio with Generated Audio

Replace the original video’s audio with the newly generated and synchronized dubbed audio, keeping the video content intact.

Tools: FFmpeg

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16 or later)
- **FFmpeg** (Ensure it’s installed and added to your system PATH)
- API keys for the services you plan to use (e.g., OpenAI, Google Cloud)

### Clone the Repository
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/marcoshmendes/witchcraft.git
$ cd witchcraft
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
$ npm install
```

### Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your API keys:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY=your_google_cloud_api_key
DEEPL_API_KEY=your_deepl_api_key
```

## Usage

### Basic Command
Run the following command, providing the URL of the YouTube video you want to dub:
```bash
$ node index.js --url <youtube_video_url> --language <target_language_code>
```
- `--url`: The YouTube video URL.
- `--language`: The target language code (e.g., `en` for English, `es` for Spanish).

### Example
```bash
$ node index.js --url https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ --language es
```
This will process the video, translate it into Spanish, and output the dubbed video with synchronized audio.

### Output
The output will be a video file with the new dubbed audio track:
```
output/final_video.mp4
```
