# Witchcraft: Automagically Dubbing Videos with AI

Witchcraft is a local AI-based tool that automagically dubs videos into different languages. This project utilizes several others open source projects to make the process of extract audio, isolate voices, transcribe, translate, and generate audio, ensuring seamless synchronization with the original video while preserving background music.
The goal of this project is to empower users to perform the dubbing process on their own machines, eliminating the need to pay for various AI tools. By providing an accessible and free solution, Witchcraft aims to enhance the reach of knowledge through the translation of educational content and beyond.
